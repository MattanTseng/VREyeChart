# XREA (VREye Chart)
This is the XREA application for the Elsevier SoftwareX journal. 
The user is presented with a snellen chart, instruction panel and Freburg Visual Acuity Test with which to create the optimal UI for their readability.

The Snellen chart is the primary testing tool. Below that chart, the user has options for text color, background color, font, and a drop down to select the desired row. 
Once the user has setup the Snellen Chart to their liking, they should press the "Preview Text" button beneath the instruction panel. This will apply the settings established on the Snellen chart to all of the other text in the scene. If the user is satisfied with how the instruction panel appears, they should move on to the Freiburg Visual Acuity Test where they can see if they are able to correctly identify the direction of a C on a canvas.

XREA has been created with the hopes of providing developers with an easy way to create customized text UI to their user in Unity Environments. 

XREA requirements: Unity Editor 2020.3.17f1 LTS
